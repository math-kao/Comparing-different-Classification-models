Comparing different Classification models to analyze the UCI Repository(Breast Cancer)

The intention is to analyze the raw performance of each model, considering the breast cancer database, therefore I'll focus on hyperparameters.

*For SVM only 'rbf' vs 'linear'

--The results

Accuracy:

Decision Tree 95,9%
SVM Kernel:RBF 95,32%  

Logistic regression:  94,73%
KNearest neighbors 94,73%
Naive Bayes 94,15%
SVM Kernel:LINEAR 94,15%  

Random Forest 93,56%
